# Redirect-Games

Redirect Games is a site that allows a user to search for a game, pulling descriptions and review from Steam, the latest videos from YouTube, and the ‘hottest’ discussions on that game from Reddit.

Also a joke regarding the struggles of figuring out what a redirect_uri was and finding it.
